Packaging for Open Source Tripwire is maintained by various third parties:

 * RPM (Fedora): http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/tripwire.git/
 
 * RPM (OpenSuSE): https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/security/tripwire

 * RPM (AIX): http://www.perzl.org/aix/index.php?n=Main.Tripwire 

 * Debian: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/tripwire

 * Gentoo: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/tripwire

 * FreeBSD Ports: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/tripwire/

 * FreshPorts (BSD): http://www.freshports.org/security/tripwire

 * MacPorts: https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/security/tripwire

 * NetBSD pkgsrc: http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/security/tripwire/README.html
    NOTE: At present (April 2016) pkgsrc only provides the obsolete Tripwire 1.2, from the mid-1990s.
    That version lacks contemporary hash algorithms, and you probably don't want to use it.
    There's an unfinished pkgsrc port for OST 2.3+ here, if someone who understands pkgsrc
    is looking for a fun(?) project: http://pkgsrc.se/wip/tripwire2


A few third party projects that might be useful with OST

 * Chef cookbook: https://github.com/rackspace-cookbooks/rackspace_tripwire

 * Puppet module: https://github.com/razorsedge/puppet-tripwire

 * SELinux policies from Tresys: https://github.com/TresysTechnology/refpolicy-contrib/blob/master/tripwire.te
   (and related .fc and .if files in the same repo)

 * A Gentoo SELinux policy, different from the one above: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sec-policy/selinux-tripwire

 * An experimental(?) Dockerfile for CentOS: https://hub.docker.com/r/prateeknischal/tripwire-play/
