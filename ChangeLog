2017-10-01 Brian Cox <bcox@tripwire.com>
	* Update version to 2.4.3.6
	* Fix & expand tests in Perl acceptance test framework
	* Fix & expand twtest unit tests, & rework unit test mini-framework so they’re referenced by name, not some numeric ID, and list tests as “skipped" if they don’t make any test assertions.

	* In examine-encryption mode, better reporting (& nonzero exit) if we can't find a keyfile for the examined file.

	* Tweak install.sh so it can be run directly, not just thru 'make install' if you want. (Github issue #26)

	* Bump version to 2.4.3.2
	* DOS/DJGPP platform support.
	* Use posix_fadvise() to reduce disk cache impact (where available).

2016-04-20 Brian Cox <bcox@tripwire.com>
	* Bump version to 2.4.3.1
	* Revive old 'twtest' unit test suite (such as it is); move _t.cpp files into twtest dir.
	* Fix -Wnarrowing warnings in yyparse.cpp - GCC 6 would treat these as errors.
	* Build with -Wextra to enable more warnings.
	* Fix a variety of other compiler warnings, some exposed by -Wextra, others preexisting.

2010-03-11 Stephane Dudzinski <tripwire@frlinux.net>

	* Added patch to fix bug [ 1962485 ] Cannot change or expect-script
	passphrases - thanks to Ross Tyler (rtyle)
	* Removed RPM spec file for now, will be fixed in next release

2007-04-16 Ron Forrester <rjf@theforrest.org>

	* Bumping all versions to 2.4.1.2
	* Fixed bug in install script when sendmail isn't installed
	  target system.
	* Removed some non-existent files from installer

2005-08-18 Ron Forrester <rjf@theforrest.org>

	* Wow, has it been 4+ years? :)
	* Starting fresh with Paul's autoconf'ed code base
	* Bumped version number, misc cleanup, etc.

2001-02-25  Ron Forrester  <rjf@theforrest.org>

	* Bumped version to 2.3.1.

	* BSD support, thanks to Paul Herman <pherman@frenchfries.net>.
	The support was added for FreeBSD 4.2, your mileage may vary on
	other BSD's.

	* Fixed long standing bug with recurse=3

	* If TEMPDIRECTORY was missing trailing /, bad things could
	happen. Tripwire now appends a / if one isn't present. Thanks
	Jarno.

	* Fixed GLOBALEMAIL bug where no global emails would be sent
	unless there were emailto attributes somewhere in the policy
	file. Additionally, reports were being sliced to global
	recipients, despite the fact that global recipients should get
	the full report.

2001-02-03  Ron Forrester  <rjf@theforrest.org>

	* Fixed possible security problem with the handling of temp
	files. We now open temp files with O_EXCL set to make sure a
	particular file doesn't already exist. Thanks to Jarno for this
	suggestion and help via a patch.

	* Added the configuration file variable TEMPDIRECTORY. This
	variable can be set to the full path to where tripwire should
	write its temporary files. By default it is /tmp. Because /tmp has
	to be world writable, this isn't a good place for tripwire to
	write temporary files. Setting TEMPDIRECTORY to a directory with
	permissions 700 is much more secure. Updated man page with info on
	this variable.

	* Added the configuration file variable GLOBALEMAIL. This variable
	can be set to a list of email addresses which are semi-colon or
	comma separated. If a report is about to be emailed to addresses
	reaped from the policy file, it will also be emailed to the
	addresses in the GLOBALEMAIL list, allowing designation of one or
	more people to always get email reports. Updated the man page with
	info on this variable.

	* Began a convention of providing a "Solution:" line to all errors
	(exceptions) emitted by tripwire. Only the two latest error
	messages incorporate this convention, but all future ones will as
	well, and I hope to revist all current errors and retrofit them
	with Solution: lines as well.
